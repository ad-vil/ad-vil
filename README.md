- 👋 Hi, I’m @ad-vil, Adil Siddiqui! I'm a sophomore in university at the Institute of Business Administration in Karachi
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Software Engineer! I also love exploring PC hardware, such as building PC's and learning in depth mechanics of each individual component, and playing video games. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java programming: Data Structures and Algorithms as of right now, as well as some Digital Logic Circuitry and Design. I also am learning to translate my java skills to python on the side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to discover a Software Engineer internship over the Summer 2024 period. Feel free to reach out for any questions or oppertunities :)

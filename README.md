- 👋 Hi, I’m @ad-vil, Adil Siddiqui! I'm a sophomore in university at the Institute of Business Administration in Karachi
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Software Engineer! I also love exploring PC hardware, such as building PC's and learning in depth mechanics of each individual component, and playing video games. 
- 🌱 I currently specialize in Java, but am simultaneously learning to implement SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, C++, and more
- 💞️ I’m looking to discover a Software Engineer internship over the Summer 2024 period. Feel free to reach out for any questions or oppertunities :)
